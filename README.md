# 12-Hour to 24-Hour Time Converter

This is a simple Python script that converts 12-hour time to 24-hour time using `if` and `else` statements.

## Usage

1. Open the `convert_time.py` file in a code editor.
2. Modify the `time_12hr` variable with the 12-hour time you want to convert.
3. Run the script.

The converted 24-hour time will be displayed in the terminal.

## How it works

The script defines a function `convert_to_24hr` that takes a 12-hour time string as input and converts it to the 24-hour format using conditional statements.
The input time is split into hour, minute, and AM/PM components.
The conversion logic adjusts the hour based on whether it's AM or PM.
The result is formatted as a string with leading zeros for hours and minutes.


# Exactly Two Positive Numbers Checker

This Python function checks whether exactly two out of three input numbers are positive.

## Usage

1. Open the `positive_checker.py` file.
2. Modify the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` with the numbers you want to check.
3. Run the script.

The function will return `True` if exactly two of the numbers are positive, otherwise it will return `False`.

# Consonant Value Calculator

This Python function calculates the highest value of consonant substrings in a given lowercase string. Consonants are any letters of the alphabet except "aeiou".

## Usage

1. Open the `consonant_value_calculator.py` file.
2. Modify the value of `k` with the lowercase string you want to analyze.
3. Run the script.

The function will return the highest value of consonant substrings present in the input string.
